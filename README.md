# 🧬 scQDiff: Schrödinger Bridge Learning of Single-Cell Regulatory Dynamics
**scQDiff** learns a **time-conditioned drift field** and extracts **regulatory archetypes** from single-cell data using a Schrödinger-Bridge / score-based formulation—then simulates **forward** (naive→perturbed) and **reverse** transitions. Includes **graph Laplacian** priors, **Fokker–Planck residual**, **AnnData/scVelo/CellRank** support, **fate-conditioned archetypes**, and **trajectory simulation** utilities.
